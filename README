To initialize get started with OpenEclair, you'll need to get
familiar with Git and Repo.

To initialize your local repository using the OpenEclair trees, 
use a command like this:

repo init -u git://github.com/openeclair/android.git

Then to sync up:

repo sync


After checking out the repositories, you'll need to create a
buildspec.mk file with contents like this:

TARGET_PRODUCT:=openeclair_dream_sapphire_us
TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT:=eng
TARGET_BUILD_TYPE:=release

files into your build, and to get things going from here:
